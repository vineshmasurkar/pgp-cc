# Launch an EC2 instance

In this guide you will be lauching an EC2 instance using terraform with the following requisites:

- Instance name: `httpserver1`
- Instance type: `t2.micro`
- Image: `ami-06d5e0de6baf595ca`
- Key pair: `pgpcc-key1`
- Security Group: `default` and `tio1-sig`
- Security Group Rules:
  - Allow HTTP(80) and SSH(22) ingress from any
  - Allow any traffic egress
- VPC: `default`
- HTTP Servers must be configured
- Configure a new service called `tio.service`

## AWS Cli

You will need to have an AWS account (free tier works) and install and configure AWS CLI to use this code. Please follow the [AWS Command Line Interface Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) if this is your first time using AWS CLI.

## Terraform

If this is your first time using Terraform, please follow [Get Started - AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started) to get familirized. You will also find the [Install Terraform Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

## How to use this code

First clone this repository on your computer. (Not sure what clone this repo means? [Here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github?specialization=google-it-automation&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_google-it-automation_google_FTCOF_professional-certificates_country-CA&campaignid=19667787599&adgroupid=148957580787&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=647783020004&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwkuqvBhAQEiwA65XxQBnia_JFxQnJ1l6fG52BEQuzp0nbDjO-Mr2hNskB2-cuMNF2SIKNrxoCCy8QAvD_BwE#modules) you go! This is free git and github course from Coursera.

Step 1: Make sure you have terraform and aws cli installed and configured.

#

Step 2: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wbox/pgp-cc.git
```

#

Step 3: Change to `pgp-cc/terraform/ec2/tio1` directory

```bash
cd pgp-cc/terraform/ec2/tio1
```

#

Step 4: Create key pair using aws cli

Currently terraform doesn't not support creation of key pair so we will need to use aws cli for this task. Make sure you save the output from this command since it will be the key to use to connect to your new instance via ssh.

```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name pgpcc-key1
```


#

Step 5: Initialize terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

#

Step 6: Execute a terraform plan to view the changes. Don't worry, nothing is going to be created in your AWS account. This is just a step for you to validate/view the changes.

```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply complete! Resources: 5 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

aws_security_group_id = "sg-02f83bf146918fe6d"
ec2_instance_id = "i-0e01d9fb8abd43bb7"

#

Check on your AWS Management Console and you will see a new instance. Compare with the values from outputs. To check if your instance is running as expected run the following command or open your browser using the ip address in the `ec2_instance_public_ip` above. In this example the IP address is 3.89.250.229. It will be different in your case.

```bash
curl http://3.89.250.229
```
#

Step 8: Now is time to destroy everything.

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

You might see something like this
